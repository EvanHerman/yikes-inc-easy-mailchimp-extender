You can register for one for free at [MailChimp](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup? "MailChimp").= How does the plugin connect my MailChimp account to my site? =Our plugin uses a MailChimp API Key to allow your site to communicate with your MailChimp account. After you enter your MailChimp API key into the plugin settings your site is connected to MailChimp and ready to make forms.= How do I create a MailChimp API key? =Go to the MailChimp article [About MailChimp API Keys](https://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/about-MailChimp API-keys) for detailed information on creating MailChimp API keys.Step-by-step instructions from MailChimp:1. Click your profile name to expand the Account Panel, and choose Account.2. Click the Extras drop-down menu and choose MailChimp API keys.3. Copy an existing MailChimp API key or click the Create A Key button.4. Name your key descriptively, so you know what application uses that key.Copy your MailChimp API key so you can paste it into the plugin General Settings.= I upgraded the plugin to version 6 and my forms disappeared! What's going on? =Version 6 of the plugin was a complete rewrite of the codebase to make the plugin better than ever. In order to do this we needed to update the shortcode format. Simply replace the old shortcodes with the new one and your forms will be back. For more information on shortcodes visit our [Knowledge Base](https://yikesinc.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/6000056637-using-shortcodes).= I'm having trouble upgrading to version 6, what do I do? =We want our current users to have as smooth a transition as possible so we have created [Guides to Updating](https://yikesinc.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/folders/6000128806). Please check them out if you are experiencing problems.= I upgraded the plugin to version 6 and now Custom Form Styles and Templates are gone. What's up with that? =In order to sustain the development of this plugin, and make it the best quality possible, we needed to move form customization to a [paid add-on](https://yikesplugins.com/plugin/form-customizer-for-easy-forms-for-mailchimp/?utm_source=wp_plugin_repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=easy_forms_for_mailchimp). The Form Customizer add-on is a powerful and easy-to-use tool to customize the look and feel of your forms without needing to know any code. If you want ultimate control of the style of your forms, please [give this add-on a try](https://yikesplugins.com/plugin/form-customizer-for-easy-forms-for-mailchimp/?utm_source=wp_plugin_repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=easy_forms_for_mailchimp).= Is there a way that I can display the number of subscribers for a given list? =Yes! In version 6.0.2.4 of Easy Forms for MailChimp by YIKES we added a new shortcode, `[yikes-mailchimp-subscriber-count]` which allows you to do just that.You can use the shortcode inside of form descriptions by adding `[yikes-mailchimp-subscriber-count]` anywhere in the description field.To display the count for a specific mailing list, you can use the `form="#"` or `list="#"` parameters. If using `form="#"` you should pass in a specific form ID, which will display the total number of subscribers associated with that form. If using `list="#"` you should pass in a MailChimp list ID.= I keep getitng the following message when I try to connect to MailChimp: `"API call to helper/ping failed: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate."` =Please see the following [Knowledge Base Article](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/i-receive-the-error-ssl-certificate-problem-unable-to-get-local-issuer-certificate-why/) on how to work around it.= I keep getitng the following message when I try to connect to MailChimp: `"We received an unexpected error: null"` =Please see the following [Knowledge Base Article](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/i-received-the-following-error-we-received-an-unexpected-error-null/) on the cause of the error and how to resolve it.== Screenshots ==1.
