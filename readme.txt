The ultimate MailChimp WordPress plugin. Easily build unlimited forms for your MailChimp lists, add them to your site and track subscriber activity.

== Description ==

Easy Forms for MailChimp allows you to add **unlimited** MailChimp sign up forms to your WordPress site. You can add forms to posts, pages, sidebars and other widgetized areas. Your MailChimp API Key connects your site to your MailChimp account and pulls in all of your MailChimp list information.

MailChimp List statistics and user activity can be viewed right from your dashboard. From there, you can manage users and list settings.

You can also extend the plugin's functionality with our [free and paid add-ons](https://yikesplugins.com/?utm_source=wp_plugin_repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=easy_forms_for_mailchimp).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**All documentation can be found in [our Knowledge Base](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/?utm_source=wp_plugin_repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=easy_forms_for_mailchimp).**

= Do I need a MailChimp account to use this plugin? =
Yes, you must have a MailChimp account and at least 1 list set up in order to use the plugin. You can register for one for free at [MailChimp](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup? "MailChimp").

= How does the plugin connect my MailChimp account to my site? =
Our plugin uses a MailChimp API Key to allow your site to communicate with your MailChimp account. After you enter your MailChimp API key into the plugin settings your site is connected to MailChimp and ready to make forms.

= How do I create a MailChimp API key? =
Go to the MailChimp article [About MailChimp API Keys](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/about-api-keys) for detailed information on creating MailChimp API keys.

Step-by-step instructions from MailChimp:

1. Click your profile name to expand the Account Panel, and choose Account.
2. Click the Extras drop-down menu and choose MailChimp API keys.
3. Copy an existing MailChimp API key or click the Create A Key button.
4. Name your key descriptively, so you know what application uses that key.

Copy your MailChimp API key so you can paste it into the plugin General Settings.

= How do I change the submit button text? =
The submit button text can be customized to use any text you like. This is done via the shortcode. Please visit our How-to article [How do I change the submit button text](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/how-do-i-change-the-submit-button-text/) for step-by-step instructions.

= How do I add new fields to my form? =
The fields that are assigned to a list are managed on the MailChimp site. To add or remove fields you need to log in to your MailChimp account and manage them there.

Please read the MailChimp article [Manage List and Signup Form Fields](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/managing-subscribers/manage-list-and-signup-form-fields) to learn how to add and edit the fields for your lists.

After you’ve added fields, they may not show up immediately in our plugin’s Form Builder. Our plugin pulls the information from MailChimp and stores it for a period of time before pulling it again. To get the new information immediately you will need to clear the MailChimp API cache. Please read our article [API Cache Settings](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/api-cache-settings/) for instructions on how to clear the MailChimp API cache.

= How do I change the field labels? =
The text next to or above each field of a form is called a “label” and you may want to change them. For instance by default MailChimp uses “First” instead of “First Name” and you may want to change it to make more sense. These labels are controlled on the MailChimp end, you will need to log into your MailChimp account to edit them. Please read the MailChimp Knowledge Base article, [Manage List and Signup Form Fields](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/managing-subscribers/manage-list-and-signup-form-fields) for detailed info on how to edit field labels.

= I’m not seeing all my lists on the drop-down menu when I go to make a new form, why? =
Our plugin fetches your list information from MailChimp and stores it on your site in a cache. If you make changes to your MailChimp lists, our plugin will update your site with those changes within an hour. If you want it updated immediately (for instance if you add a new list), you can delete the MailChimp cache. Please read [our Knowledge Base Article](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/im-not-seeing-all-my-lists-on-the-drop-down-menu-when-i-go-to-make-a-new-form/?utm_source=wp_plugin_repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=easy_forms_for_mailchimp) for more info.

= Is there a way to display the number of subscribers for a given list? =
Yes! You can use the shortcode, `[yikes-mailchimp-subscriber-count]` in the form description field to display the number of subscribers to that MailChimp list.

To display the count for a specific MailChimp list, you can use the `form="#"` or `list="#"` parameters. If using `form="#"` you should pass in a specific form ID, which will display the total number of subscribers associated with that form. If using `list="#"` you should pass in a MailChimp list ID.

= I want to use my own styles. Can I remove the styles bundled with this plugin? =
Yes, we've included a constant you can use to prevent our styles from loading, `YIKES_MAILCHIMP_EXCLUDE_STYLES`. For usage, please see [our Knowledge Base Article](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/how-do-i-deregister-the-styles-included-with-this-plugin/?utm_source=wp_plugin_repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=easy_forms_for_mailchimp).

= Some of the characters in my form are being stored as ??? instead of in the correct format. =
You'll want to make sure that your database collation is set properly. The best collation setting for all web languages is UTF8. If you need help switching collation settings in your database, please see the following article from Media Temple: [Default MySQL character set and collation](https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/204403914/default-mysql-character-set-and-collation).

= I'm having trouble upgrading to version 6, what do I do? =
We want our users to have as smooth a transition as possible so we created [Guides to Updating](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/product/installation-easy-forms-for-mailchimp/?utm_source=wp_plugin_repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=easy_forms_for_mailchimp). Please check them out if you are experiencing problems.

= Can I define my API key using a PHP constant, inside of wp-config.php? =
Yes! Since version 6.1.2 of Easy Forms for MailChimp we have enabled the ability to define a PHP constant inside of wp-config.php to be used throughout the plugin. The constant name you'll want to use is `YIKES_MC_API_KEY`. Once you've defined your constant, you'll want to head into the options page and save your settings for the changes to take hold.

Example:
`define( 'YIKES_MC_API_KEY', '12345679-us2' );`

* Refactored all v2 endpoints that are unsupported in v3 to use the new API classes

* Added/Updated filters for each custom message type. See the `Filters` section for more details.

* Version 6.3.0 includes a suite of bug fixes, enhancements, and changes:

* Under-the-hood improvements and enhancements

As noted above, this release modifies this plugin to utilize the Options API instead of a custom database table. After upgrading, a routine will run that will grab all of your forms from the custom database table and convert them into a WordPress Option that the code will use from this point forward. At this point, we're choosing to keep the existing custom database table in place, so you can rest assured that all of your form data will be safe.

If for some reason you need to revert to using the custom database table, you can add a constant to your `wp-config.php` file:

`define( 'YIKES_EMCE_CUSTOM_DB', true );`

If you find that you *need* to do this, please contact us to let us know what you're seeing. In a future release, we will remove the custom database table entirely.
