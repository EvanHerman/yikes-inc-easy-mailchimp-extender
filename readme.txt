The ultimate MailChimp WordPress plugin. Easily build unlimited forms for your MailChimp lists, add them to your site and track subscriber activity.

== Description ==

Easy Forms for MailChimp allows you to add **unlimited** MailChimp sign up forms to your WordPress site. You can add forms to posts, pages, sidebars and other widgetized areas. Your MailChimp API Key connects your site to your account and pulls in all of your list information.

List statistics and user activity can be viewed right from your dashboard. From there, you can manage users and list settings.

You can also extend the plugin's functionality with our [free and paid add-ons](https://yikesplugins.com/?utm_source=wp_plugin_repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=easy_forms_for_mailchimp).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**All documentation can be found in [our Knowledge Base](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/?utm_source=wp_plugin_repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=easy_forms_for_mailchimp).**

= Do I need a MailChimp account to use this plugin? =
Yes, you must have a MailChimp account and at least 1 list set up in order to use the plugin. You can register for one for free at [their website](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup?).

= How does the plugin connect my MailChimp account to my site? =
Our plugin uses an API Key to allow your site to communicate with your account. After you enter your API key into the plugin settings your site is connected to your account and ready to make forms.

= How do I create a MailChimp API key? =
Go to the article [About MailChimp API Keys](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/about-api-keys) for detailed information on creating API keys.

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Click your profile name to expand the Account Panel, and choose Account.
2. Click the Extras drop-down menu and choose MailChimp API keys.
3. Copy an existing API key or click the Create A Key button.
4. Name your key descriptively, so you know what application uses that key.

Copy your API key so you can paste it into the plugin General Settings.

= How do I change the submit button text? =
The submit button text can be customized to use any text you like. This is done via the shortcode. Please visit our How-to article [How do I change the submit button text](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/how-do-i-change-the-submit-button-text/) for step-by-step instructions.

= How do I add new fields to my form? =
The fields that are assigned to a list are managed on the MailChimp site. To add or remove fields you need to log in to your account and manage them there.

Please read the article [Manage List and Signup Form Fields](http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/managing-subscribers/manage-list-and-signup-form-fields) to learn how to add and edit the fields for your lists.

After you’ve added fields, they may not show up immediately in our plugin’s Form Builder. Our plugin pulls the information from your lists and stores it for a period of time before pulling it again. To get the new information immediately you will need to clear the MailChimp API cache. Please read our article [API Cache Settings](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/api-cache-settings/) for instructions on how to clear the MailChimp API cache.

= How do I change the field labels? =
The text next to or above each field of a form is called a “label” and you may want to change them. For instance by default MailChimp uses “First” instead of “First Name” and you may want to change it to make more sense. In the form builder, you will find a little pencil icon next to each form label. Click that icon to edit the label and hit the check icon to save it. After you are done editing field labels you will need to hit the "Update Form" button to save all of your changes.

= I’m not seeing all my lists on the drop-down menu when I go to make a new form, why? =
Our plugin fetches your list information from your account and stores it on your site in a cache. If you make changes to your lists, our plugin will update your site with those changes within an hour. If you want it updated immediately (for instance if you add a new list), you can delete the cache. Please read [our Knowledge Base Article](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/im-not-seeing-all-my-lists-on-the-drop-down-menu-when-i-go-to-make-a-new-form/?utm_source=wp_plugin_repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=easy_forms_for_mailchimp) for more info.

= Is there a way to display the number of subscribers for a given list? =
Yes! You can use the shortcode, `[yikes-mailchimp-subscriber-count]` in the form description field to display the number of subscribers to that list.

To display the count for a specific list, you can use the `form="#"` or `list="#"` parameters. If using `form="#"` you should pass in a specific form ID, which will display the total number of subscribers associated with that form. If using `list="#"` you should pass in a list ID.

= I want to use my own styles. Can I remove the styles bundled with this plugin? =
Yes, we've included a constant you can use to prevent our styles from loading, `YIKES_MAILCHIMP_EXCLUDE_STYLES`. For usage, please see [our Knowledge Base Article](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/how-do-i-deregister-the-styles-included-with-this-plugin/?utm_source=wp_plugin_repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=easy_forms_for_mailchimp).

= Some of the characters in my form are being stored as ??? instead of in the correct format. =
You'll want to make sure that your database collation is set properly. The best collation setting for all web languages is UTF8. If you need help switching collation settings in your database, please see the following article from Media Temple: [Default MySQL character set and collation](https://mediatemple.net/community/products/dv/204403914/default-mysql-character-set-and-collation).

= I'm having trouble upgrading to version 6, what do I do? =
We want our users to have as smooth a transition as possible so we created [Guides to Updating](https://yikesplugins.com/support/knowledge-base/product/installation-easy-forms-for-mailchimp/?utm_source=wp_plugin_repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=easy_forms_for_mailchimp). Please check them out if you are experiencing problems.

= Can I define my API key using a PHP constant, inside of wp-config.php? =
Yes! Since version 6.1.2 we have enabled the ability to define a PHP constant inside of wp-config.php to be used throughout the plugin. The constant name you'll want to use is `YIKES_MC_API_KEY`. Once you've defined your constant, you'll want to head into the options page and save your settings for the changes to take hold.

Example:
`define( 'YIKES_MC_API_KEY', '12345679-us2' );`

* Replaced the current loading gifs with SVGs
* Added support for address field placeholder values. You can filter these values with the filter `yikes-mailchimp-address-{$addr_type}-placeholder`.
* Added support for single opt-in unsubscribed users to re-subscribe. Shout out to @jasonhildebrand for adding this functionality. 
* Fixed an issue with interest groups. This should fix the "Invalid Interest Group: 0" error some users saw. Another really big shoutout to @jasonhildebrand for fixing this directly.
* Fixed up some PHP warnings - thanks to @szepeviktor on GitHub for reporting these.

= 6.3.26 - October 4th, 2017 =

= 6.3.23 - August 14th, 2017 =
* Removed an additional `esc_url` call on the redirect URL. Redirect URLs should now be able to accept characters like ampersands without encoding them.

* Added a filter - `yikes-mailchimp-integration-is-user-subscribed` - for the integration checkbox. You can override whether the checkbox will display for already subscribed users (by default, the checkbox will not display).
* Updated the way we're logging errors for the homepage dashboard widgets - an error should no longer break your dashboard!
* Added some default excluded post types for our post query on the form builder (CPTS are forum, topic, and reply). This should help people who use bbPress and are experiencing timeout issues. (These can be filtered with the `yikes-mailchimp-excluded-redirect-post-types`).

= 6.3.19 - May 16th, 2017 =
* Fixed a bug where hidden form fields were being counted as visible.

* Added a filter, `yikes-mailchimp-checkbox-integration-body`, for the checkbox integrations. You can now filter the entire request body before it's sent to MailChimp.

= 6.3.17 - May 1st, 2017 =
* Added a quick fix for the Addon Settings list 

= 6.3.16 - April 26th, 2017 =

* Added the Clear API Cache button to the form builder - you can find the button in the Associated List Settings box.
* Added a new option to the fields in the form builder: the ability to place the description above the field. This also comes with some minor style changes and a couple new filters: `'yikes-mailchimp-{$interest_group_id}-description-html'` to filter the interest group's description HTML, and `'yikes-mailchimp-{$merge_tag}-description-html'` to filter a form/merge field's description HTML.
* Added HTML so that labels will work properly in the form builder. You can now select input fields by clicking on the field's label.

= 6.3.14 - April 21st, 2017 =
* Updating the WooCommerce Checkout integration checkbox with a new class and a filter for the classes (yikes-mailchimp-wooco-integration-checkbox-classes). The checkbox should now align correctly. 
* Added a new setting to the General Setting page that controls using the nonce validation. The nonce has caused numerous people issues, and the filter is difficult for some people. This new setting will turn off the nonce validation for all forms on the website. The previously added filter, yikes-mailchimp-use-nonce-verification, can still turn off nonce validation on a per-form basis.

= 6.3.13 - April 17th, 2017 = 
* Two new filters: `yikes-mailchimp-wp-comment-integration-placement` and `yikes-mailchimp-use-nonce-verification`.
* `yikes-mailchimp-use-nonce-verification` - Control whether we verify the nonce on form submissions. Default: `true` (by default, we check the nonce). @params: $use_nonce, $form_id
* `yikes-mailchimp-wp-comment-integration-placement` - Control the placement of the subscription checkbox for the WP Comment Form integration. Default: `comment_form_field_comment` (after the comment textarea box) - @params: $comment_form_field. This filter allows you to choose which WP Comment Form filter to use, and for the full list of WP Comment Form filters, check the documentation: https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/comment_form.

= 6.3.11 - March 23rd, 2017 =

= 6.3.10 - March 21st, 2017 =
* Added a filter to customize the options in the states' dropdown. You can now add your own states/provinces, or remove the default ones. Use `yikes-mailchimp-state-province-list`

= 6.3.5 - February 13th, 2017 =
* Added Canadian provinces to the state dropdown list. If you choose "Canada" as your country, you will see only the provinces. If you choose U.S. you will see only the states. For all other countries, the dropdown will fade out.

* The second address line (addr2) is never required by default (this can be changed using a filter - see `yikes-mailchimp-address-2-required`).

* Updated the storage of form data to utilize the Options API instead of a custom database table.
* Under-the-hood improvements and enhancements

As noted above, this release modifies this plugin to utilize the Options API instead of a custom database table. After upgrading, a routine will run that will grab all of your forms from the custom database table and convert them into a WordPress Option that the code will use from this point forward. At this point, we're choosing to keep the existing custom database table in place, so you can rest assured that all of your form data will be safe.

If for some reason you need to revert to using the custom database table, you can add a constant to your `wp-config.php` file:

`define( 'YIKES_EMCE_CUSTOM_DB', true );`

If you find that you *need* to do this, please contact us to let us know what you're seeing. In a future release, we will remove the custom database table entirely.
